# GhostChatApp-Frontend
Ghost Chat App is a real-time chat application that is developed using React JS as the front-end development library and Node JS as the back-end development technology. This chat application supports both one-to-one as well as group chat. 


It is implemented using a document-based database named MongoDB and I got to learn the ways to establish the connection between the front-end and the back-end of the application. I also explored MongoDB ATLAS and Mongoose library for more convenient implementation.
